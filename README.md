# ACV_Profiles
This is an older and first of my projects working with an accelerometer to measure bar velocity on the back squat and bench presss. 
The files were based on actual training sessions that had a standardized warm up and load increase increments based on load relative to the individual.
It was based on the 4-point method where 4 loads were used. The file creates a scatter plot with both the linear and polynomial regressions. 
Finally, a table is created to the correlated repititions in reserve (RIR) to velocities. RIR is a subjected method controlling an exercise session.
